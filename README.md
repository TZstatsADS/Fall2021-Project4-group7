	+ Ayati-Ghaffari, Arya aa4663@columbia.edu
	+ Chen, Xueying xc2578@columbia.edu
	+ Dong, Stella zd2268@columbia.edu

 The designated presenter is Zou, Yixuan
+ Project summary: In this project, we will implement and compare algorithms handling Disparate Treatment & Mistreatment as well as Conditional Discrimination. Implementation and evaluation will be based on the COMPAS dataset, which contains the defendants' recidivsim risk score (COMPAS), race, gender, age, criminal history, prison time, etc. Our goal is to compare the performance and efficiency of the above algorithms.
	
**Contribution statement**: Yixuan Zou implements DM algorithm (Model with constrains dealing disparate overall mistreatment A4_Group7.ipynb) and prejudice remover algorithm (Prejudice Remover Regularizer Group7.ipynb), Stelly Dong implemenets DMsen algorithm (proj_DMsen.ipynb), Ruopu Fan helps on data processing and github repo editing. Arya Ayati-Ghaffari and Xueying Chen implemenet (A6-LM.ipynb,notebook_env.db,trialsReg.txt)
